notes: "<p>Coral Gables, in South Florida, is applying smart city concepts to improve\
  \ citizen and business services as it innovates and develops next-step processes\
  \ advancing the vision of the City\u2019s founder, George Merrick. Established in\
  \ 1925, Coral Gables was one of the first \u2018planned cities\u2019 in the United\
  \ States, and was built and inspired by the City Beautiful Movement. Our first initiative\
  \ captures Coral Gables' collaboration with the University of Miami on a \u201C\
  Design your Coral Gables: Smart City Solutions Contest 2019\u201D. This initiative\
  \ provides access to data sets and a platform wherein teams can collaborate to advance\
  \ their designs. The challenge invites participants to prototype technology solutions\
  \ for transportation and traffic challenges facing the City that can improve quality\
  \ of life for residents and visitors.</p>"
